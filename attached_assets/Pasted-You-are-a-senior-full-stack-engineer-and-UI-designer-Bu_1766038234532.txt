You are a senior full‑stack engineer and UI designer. 
Build a full responsive web app called “KwikMedi – Medicine Delivery Service” inspired by https://kwikmedi.com, but use all‑original code, wording, and images (do NOT copy their code or text).

TECH STACK
- Frontend: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- Styling: CSS modules or a single global CSS file, no CSS frameworks
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB using Mongoose (read connection string from env var MONGODB_URI)
- Project must run with: npm install, npm run dev

OVERALL STYLE
- Clean, modern healthcare look.
- Primary colors: white background, teal/green accents, dark gray text.
- Use Google font “Inter” or “Poppins”.
- Mobile‑first responsive layout using flexbox / CSS grid.
- Sticky header, smooth scrolling for on‑page anchors.
- Layout and UX similar in spirit to KwikMedi screens: hero banner, medicines categories grid, lab tests grid, testimonials, login with phone, footer etc. (based on screenshots and structure).

ROUTING & PAGES (FRONTEND)
Use React Router and create these main routes:

1) "/"  – Home (landing) page
2) "/medicines" – All Medicines listing
3) "/lab-tests" – Lab Tests & Health Checkups listing
4) "/login" – Phone number login / OTP screen
5) "/cart" – Simple cart preview (client‑side state only)
6) "/profile" – Basic profile/dashboard after login (just a placeholder)

========================
BACKEND: EXPRESS + MONGODB
========================
Structure example:
- /server
  - index.ts (or index.js)
  - routes/
  - models/
  - controllers/

Use Mongoose models:

User:
- phone (string, required, unique)
- createdAt (Date, default now)

Medicine:
- name (string, required)
- category (string, required)
- description (string)
- price (number, required)
- discountPercent (number, default 0)
- imageUrl (string, optional)

LabTest:
- name (string, required)
- category (string)
- description (string)
- price (number)

ContactRequest:
- name, phone, email, message, createdAt

API endpoints (prefix /api):

AUTH:
- POST /api/auth/send-otp
  - body: { phone }
  - simulate OTP = "123456", do NOT integrate SMS, just log it and respond { success: true }.
- POST /api/auth/verify-otp
  - body: { phone, otp }
  - If otp === "123456": find-or-create User, return { token: "fake-jwt-token", user: { phone } }.

MEDICINES:
- GET /api/medicines
  - query: search, category
  - filter medicines accordingly.
- Optional: GET /api/medicines/popular to return subset.

LAB TESTS:
- GET /api/lab-tests
  - query: search, category

CONTACT:
- POST /api/contact
  - body: { name, phone, email, message }
  - Save ContactRequest and return { success: true }.

HEALTH CHECK:
- GET /api/health → { status: "ok" }

Database:
- In server startup, if medicines or labTests collections are empty, seed with some demo data (a few medicines and tests with prices, matching the categories).

Server setup:
- Use dotenv for env variables (MONGODB_URI, PORT).
- Connect to MongoDB via `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI)`.
- Enable CORS for the React frontend origin.
- In development, run backend on port 5000 and frontend on Vite’s default port (e.g., 5173). Configure frontend API base URL accordingly (e.g., via environment variable).

========================
SCRIPTS & PROJECT SETUP
========================
Project root:
- package.json with scripts:
  - "install": install dependencies in both client and server if needed
  - "dev": run client and server concurrently (e.g., using `concurrently` package)
  - "server": run backend dev
  - "client": run frontend dev
- Clear README.md with run instructions for Replit:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
- Ensure TypeScript configs (tsconfig) are correct for both client and server.

The final output must be a working Replit project that:
- Uses this design and navigation structure.
- Has a functioning Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend with the routes described.
- Has a React frontend that calls the backend for medicines, lab tests, auth (fake OTP), and contact form.
- Looks visually similar in layout to the provided KwikMedi screenshots while using original text and assets.
